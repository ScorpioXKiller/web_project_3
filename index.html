                            Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the shores of the Dnipro river. 
                            Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, 
                            in which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot here, and the winters are drafty, 
                            but the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.

                            The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet architecture, 
                            all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro, 
                            the landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels. 
                            The left bank is considered far less interesting and prestigious though, 
                            even by people who live on the far outskirts of the right one.

                            The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below from a rock that juts out into the sea. 
                            It is thought to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some 900 years later, 
                            the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia has become a popular tourist destination during the summer months.

                            Another claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five years in a row for its spectacular floral displays around town. 
                            It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.

                            It's known as the arts and crafts capital of the state, 
                            and visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: 
                            shops with handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more. 
                            The town holds a yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", 
                            a local dish made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.

                            Berea College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the south to be racially integrated, 
                            as well as the first to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, 
                            it charges no tuition — every student receives a full-tuition scholarship.

                            Haifa is Israel’s third largest city. It sits on the slopes of Mount Carmel facing the Mediterranean Sea. 
                            Some call it ‘Israel’s San Francisco’.  Although traditionally a working city, 
                            there are a number of great things to do in Haifa. Be sure to cross them off your Haifa bucket list. 
                            These include the Bahai Gardens and German Colony. It also houses a number of top museums. 
                            The city is also famous across Israel for its mixed population of Jews and Arabs. 
                            Here, they peacefully coexist. The result is some amazing fusions of Arabic and Jewish cultures across the city.

                            Set upon Mount Carmel, Haifa is an unusual city to navigate. 
                            However, the advantage is that its scenery and terrain is stunning. From the top of Mount Carmel, 
                            take in the view from the Louis Promenade across the Port of Haifa. 
                            It heads north right across into the Western Galilee. Hop on the Carmelit, Israel’s only subway system. 
                            It travels up and down the mountain. At the bottom check out Hof Hacarmel, Haifa’s beaches.

                            The city’s crown jewel when it comes to tourism is undoubtedly the Bah’ai Gardens. 
                            They form part of the Bah’ai World Center, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
                            These beautiful gardens are a place of pilgrimage for members of the Bah’ai faith. 
                            They sit on terraces sloping down Mount Carmel towards the beautiful Mediterranean Sea. 
                            At the bottom of the gardens is Haifa’s German Colony. 
                            The area’s famous for its pretty streets of restored templar-era buildings. 
                            The main street of the German Colony runs directly from the bottom of the gardens towards the coast and is lined with restaurants and cafes.
